        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Raised in Virginia, I grew up building things in blocks and Legos. I remember being fascinated by all of the possible things I can make in my playground box. Naturally this extended to larger and larger domains as I competed in robotics competitions in high school. At University of Virginia I studied Engineering, graduated with a degree in Physics, and could call myself master of the universe--or at least an acolyte or something like that.</p>
        <p>Soon after I got my first software development job at Lockheed Martin in Washington DC and boy was I overwhelmed. It helped awaken in me the "soft" skills that I did not think I needed as a software engineer like taking responsibility, empathetic listening, predicting workload, and learning how to learn quickly.</p>
        <p>Since then I continue to build solutions which make the world a better place. I believe that the more we learn about the world and from our mistakes, the better equipped we are to making it a better place.</p>
