  "description": "Civil Open Base for Review and Analytics (COBRA) is a big data, on premise & hybrid platform for legal review and e-discovery. Federal agencies with non-existent litigation budgets use the platform to upload, organize, and identify documents with pertinent evidence for court matters. Users read through documents to identify portions that support court case matters. Then machine learning models fine tune their prediction capabilities on these new inputs. Once the models are updated, they eliminate near duplicate documents or suggest documents of different topics to increase the robustness of the model.",
