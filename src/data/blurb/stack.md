# Current Stack

There's a problem with the way "full stack" has encompassed groups of overlapping technologies. These options range from LAMP, Java, C#, Python, Golang, and more. Over the course of my career, I started with developing in Java and NodeJS stacks and evolved to building cloud-native applications.

Despite being proficient in a wide range of technologies, I can tell that I still suffer from the "back-end developer posing as a front-end developer" syndrome--I can't build the prettiest interfaces, but I can make sure everything runs efficiently and smoothly in the back.

While I am developing an interesting way of visualizing the technologies I am working on, I am working with the current technologies:

| Languages | Frameworks | Technologies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | Angular + React| |
| TypeScript | NodeJS | AWS |
| Python | Flask | PostgreSQL |
| Golang | Terraform | Docker |
| Bash | CI/CD | Jenkins |
