  "description": "There's an issue with all of the websites that Professor Agrawala has, and it is that all of these websites lack a central data source. All of the websites about him display only a certain aspect about the main--even Google Scholar is not all-encompassing. His common works are listed as duplicates in almost 8 different websites. I could come up with an algorithm to remove all exact duplicate titles and potentially do some checking on near duplicates",
