  "description": "Currently the CI/CD pipeline for the MIND Lab site is hosted on my machine. This is not a major concern because I am basically the only one who deploys anything using that CI/CD pipeline. However it would be nice to move the CI/CD server to MIND Lab's servers so I do not need to manage the processes.",
